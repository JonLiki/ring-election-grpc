This project implements a **distributed Leader Election protocol** based on the **LCR (LeLann‚ÄìChang‚ÄìRoberts)** algorithm using **gRPC**.  
Nodes form a **logical ring**, each knowing only its direct successor.  
The system supports **dynamic joining**, **leader election**, and **automatic failure recovery**.

## üöÄ Features

- LCR Ring-based Leader Election
- Fault Detection via Heartbeats
- Self-Healing Ring (auto-repair when a node fails)
- Dynamic Node Registration (via Register Node)
- Leader Announcement Broadcast

---

## üèõ System Overview

### Register Node
- Runs on port `5000`
- Maintains ordered list of nodes in ring
- Repairs ring when a node fails

### Regular Nodes
- Join ring through register node
- Monitor successor via heartbeat
- Participate in election and forward messages

---

## üîÅ Leader Election (LCR Algorithm)

1. Any node can start the election.
2. It sends:
   ```
   ELECTION(candidateId = self.id, originId = self.id)
   ```
3. Each node forwards the **maximum candidateId** seen.
4. When the message returns to the originator, that node becomes the **Leader**.
5. Leader sends `LEADER(leaderId)` announcement around the ring.

---

## üíÄ Failure Detection & Repair

- Each node `PING`s its successor every 3 seconds.
- If successor fails to respond 3 times:
  - It reports failure to register node.
  - Register removes failed node & relinks ring.
  - Register instructs predecessor to update nextPort.

Ring continues operation ‚Äî no restart required.

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Run

### 1) Build Project
```sh
mvn clean package
```

### 2) Start Register Node (first terminal)
```sh
mvn org.codehaus.mojo:exec-maven-plugin:3.1.0:java "-Dexec.mainClass=cs324.ring.election.grpc.Node"
```
```
Is this the register node? (true/false): true
```

### 3) Start Regular Nodes (new terminal per node)
```sh
mvn org.codehaus.mojo:exec-maven-plugin:3.1.0:java "-Dexec.mainClass=cs324.ring.election.grpc.Node"
```
```
Is this the register node? (true/false): false
Enter Node ID: 1
Enter Port: 5001
```

### 4) Start Election
```
1
```

### 5) Exit Node
```
2
```
